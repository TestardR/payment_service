# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Circuit Breaker for External Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 21
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies.
# Details:
1. Implement CircuitBreaker in infrastructure/resilience/circuit_breaker.go:
   - Define interface for circuit breaker
   - Implement state machine (closed, open, half-open)
   - Add failure counting and thresholds
   - Implement timeout for recovery
   - Add metrics for circuit breaker state
2. Apply circuit breaker to file system operations
3. Apply circuit breaker to database operations
4. Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations

Use a lightweight circuit breaker library like github.com/sony/gobreaker (v0.5.0). Implement proper logging for circuit breaker state changes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for circuit breaker logic. Test state transitions. Test failure counting and recovery. Verify metrics are properly updated. Test fallback mechanisms.
