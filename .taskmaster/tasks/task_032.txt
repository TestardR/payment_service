# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Graceful Shutdown
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 29
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement graceful shutdown for the application.
# Details:
1. Implement shutdown logic in cmd/server/main.go:
   - Capture SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
   - Initiate graceful shutdown of HTTP server
   - Close database connections
   - Stop background workers
   - Wait for in-flight requests to complete
   - Log shutdown progress
2. Implement timeout for shutdown process
3. Add health check status update during shutdown
4. Implement connection draining for HTTP server

Use context cancellation for coordinating shutdown across components. Implement proper resource cleanup.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests for graceful shutdown. Test shutdown with in-flight requests. Verify resources are properly cleaned up. Test shutdown timeout.
