# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement HTTP Authentication Middleware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create HTTP basic authentication middleware for securing API endpoints.
# Details:
1. Implement authentication middleware in infrastructure/http/middleware/auth.go:
   - Parse Authorization header
   - Validate credentials against configuration
   - Implement proper error handling for missing or invalid credentials
   - Add logging for authentication failures
2. Use environment variables for credential configuration
3. Implement secure credential comparison to prevent timing attacks
4. Add rate limiting for failed authentication attempts
5. Implement proper HTTP status codes (401 for authentication failures)

Use the standard library's subtle.ConstantTimeCompare for secure credential comparison. Implement proper logging for security events.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for authentication middleware. Test valid credentials, invalid credentials, missing credentials. Test rate limiting for failed attempts. Verify proper HTTP status codes and headers in responses.
