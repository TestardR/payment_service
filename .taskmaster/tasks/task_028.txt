# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Structured Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement structured logging throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Implement logging infrastructure in infrastructure/logging/logger.go:
   - Use Go's standard library slog package (introduced in Go 1.21)
   - Configure JSON output format
   - Define log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Implement context-aware logging with request ID
   - Add common fields (timestamp, service name, etc.)
2. Implement logging middleware for HTTP requests
3. Add logging throughout application components
4. Implement log level configuration via environment variables
5. Add performance logging for slow operations

Use structured logging with consistent field names. Include contextual information in all log entries.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for logging logic. Verify log format and content. Test different log levels. Verify context values are properly included in log entries.
