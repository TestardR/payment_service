# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the XML file generator for persisting payment data in XML format.
# Details:
1. Implement XMLGenerator in infrastructure/persistence/xml/payment_xml_generator.go:
   - Implement GenerateXML method to create XML from payment data
   - Implement SaveXML method to write XML to file system
   - Use encoding/xml package for XML generation
   - Implement proper file naming convention
   - Add file system error handling
2. Create XML structure matching the requirements
3. Implement file system operations with proper error handling
4. Add atomic file write operations to prevent partial writes
5. Implement directory structure for organizing XML files
6. Add file cleanup mechanism for old XML files

Use os.WriteFile with temporary file and rename for atomic writes. Implement proper error handling for file system operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for XML generation logic. Create integration tests for file system operations. Verify XML structure matches requirements. Test error handling for file system failures. Test atomic write operations.
