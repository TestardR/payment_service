# Task ID: 16
# Title: Setup Project Structure with Clean Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Go project with proper module structure following Clean Architecture and DDD principles as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Initialize Go module with `go mod init payment-processor`
2. Create directory structure following the PRD specifications:
   - internal/domain/ (payment, shared)
   - internal/application/ (command, query, port, service)
   - internal/infrastructure/ (persistence, http, worker)
3. Setup go.mod with Go 1.24.4 requirement
4. Configure basic linting tools: gofmt, go vet, golint, staticcheck
5. Create initial README.md with project overview
6. Setup .gitignore file for Go projects
7. Create Makefile with common commands (build, test, lint)
8. Initialize basic configuration management structure using environment variables
9. Setup conventional commits git hooks

# Test Strategy:
Verify directory structure matches PRD specifications. Ensure go.mod is properly configured with correct Go version. Validate that all development tools can be executed via Makefile commands.
