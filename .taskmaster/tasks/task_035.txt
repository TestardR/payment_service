# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Application Assembly and Dependency Injection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 29, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Create application assembly with proper dependency injection.
# Details:
1. Implement application assembly in cmd/server/main.go:
   - Create all components with proper dependencies
   - Wire up layers (domain, application, infrastructure)
   - Configure HTTP server and routes
   - Start background workers
   - Initialize database connection
2. Use constructor injection for dependencies
3. Implement clean separation of concerns
4. Add proper error handling for initialization failures

Use manual dependency injection without external frameworks. Implement proper resource initialization order.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests for application assembly. Verify all components are properly initialized. Test initialization failures. Verify proper dependency injection.
