# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Configuration Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create configuration management for application settings.
# Details:
1. Implement configuration in infrastructure/config/config.go:
   - Define configuration struct with all settings
   - Load configuration from environment variables
   - Implement validation for required settings
   - Provide sensible defaults
   - Add support for configuration file (optional)
2. Include settings for:
   - HTTP server (port, timeouts)
   - Database (connection string, pool size)
   - File system (paths for XML and CSV)
   - Authentication (credentials)
   - Logging (level, format)
3. Implement validation for all settings
4. Add logging of configuration at startup (excluding sensitive values)

Use environment variables as the primary configuration source. Implement proper validation for all settings.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for configuration loading and validation. Test with valid and invalid configurations. Test default values. Verify sensitive values are not logged.
