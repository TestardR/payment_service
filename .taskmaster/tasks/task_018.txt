# Task ID: 18
# Title: Design and Implement SQLite Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the SQLite database schema for payment records with proper indexes and constraints.
# Details:
1. Create SQLite database schema with the following tables:
   - payments: id (primary key), debtor_iban, debtor_name, creditor_iban, creditor_name, amount, currency, idempotency_key (unique), status, created_at, updated_at
2. Add appropriate indexes:
   - Unique index on idempotency_key
   - Index on status for efficient filtering
   - Index on created_at for chronological queries
3. Implement database migration using a lightweight migration tool like golang-migrate
4. Create SQL scripts for:
   - Schema creation
   - Indexes
   - Test data population
5. Implement connection pooling with proper configuration
6. Add database health check query

Use parameterized queries throughout to prevent SQL injection. Configure appropriate connection pool settings with timeouts.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests that verify schema creation, constraint enforcement, and index usage. Test unique constraint on idempotency_key. Verify connection pooling works correctly under load. Test migration scripts for both up and down migrations.
