# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Payment API Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the REST API endpoint for payment submission.
# Details:
1. Implement PaymentHandler in infrastructure/http/handler/payment_handler.go:
   - Implement POST /v1/payments endpoint
   - Parse and validate request body
   - Convert request to command
   - Call application service
   - Format response with payment ID
   - Implement proper error handling
2. Use standard library's net/http package
3. Implement middleware chain with authentication and logging
4. Add request ID generation for correlation
5. Implement proper HTTP status codes
6. Add response headers (Content-Type, etc.)

Use context for request cancellation and timeouts. Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for handler logic using httptest package. Test successful requests, validation failures, authentication failures. Verify proper HTTP status codes and response bodies. Test request cancellation and timeouts.
